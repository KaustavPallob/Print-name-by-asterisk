# Print_your_name_by_asterisk

#This is a repository for printing any name by asterisk. 

#This code can print any name which contain 13 characters. 

#I develop all the 26 characters in this program and fetch according to the requirement.

#In general when we want to print two or more shapes in the same program one after another then the second shap is display in the bottom of other. 

#So for avoiding this problem I use SetConsoleCursorPosition() function which is declare in Windows.h header file. 

#This function is use for CODE::BLOCKS IDE if u are a person who use TURBO C then you need to use goto xy() function.

#IF any one want more information about SetConsoleCursorPosition() function please visit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEmzyepukxg
